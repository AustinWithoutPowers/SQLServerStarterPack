# SQLServerStarterPack (SSSP)
Creating a template for spinning up new SQL Server projects.

## Lite
Use this if you are not looking for a fully optimised project, and rather keen to get right into it. It also requires less base knowledge of SQL Server and setting up a SQL Server server, so is recommended for beginners.

It contains a reduced amount of configuration and makes assumptions on resourcing, collations, etc. It will by default disable features that enable extra tracking or restoration to save space and performance. It *should* still create an envrionment that will be functional, it will just not be fully optimised for desired workloads and various server capacities.

It **should not** be used for deploying to a production environment. 

# FullCream
Use this is you are looking for a fully optimised project, and offers more customisation based on server settings, database settings, schemas, etc.

More updates coming.
